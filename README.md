# Knowledge & Learning

**Knowledge & Learning** is a lightweight, open, browser-based learning site built to help young students practice core academic skills in a simple, motivating way.

The project started as a math practice tool for my younger brothers (4th–5th grade), but it is intentionally designed to grow into a broader learning platform covering additional subjects over time.

The site is public, free to use, and requires no accounts or personal information.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to:

- Make daily practice simple, short, and consistent
- Turn repetition into something interactive rather than tedious
- Track progress without accounts, logins, or data collection
- Provide a foundation that can expand beyond math into other subjects

At its core, this is about **learning through small wins**.

## 🌱 Planned Expansion

This repository is meant to grow gradually and responsibly. Planned future areas include:

- Additional math topics (fractions, decimals, word problems)
- Printable practice worksheets
- Structured “courses” by grade level
- Science and reading comprehension modules
- Short guides paired with practice and quizzes
- Improved visual polish and accessibility

Each feature is added incrementally to avoid complexity creep.

## 💬 Notes

This project is intentionally simple by design.  
Complexity is added only when it meaningfully improves learning.
